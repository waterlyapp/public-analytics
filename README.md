# public-analytics
This repository contains Waterly-published analyses of public water-related datasets. It is using jupyter notebooks that were executed in DataSpell, although they should be executable anywhere that jupyter notebooks can be used. 

It is recommended to use a unique python .venv for this project.

Users can download the datasets by utilizing the DataDownloader.ipynb file. Running all of the cells downloads all necessary files. 

Dependencies that are required to execute the notebooks can be installed using the reuirements.txt file. Users can run the following code to install all dependencies:

- pip install -r requirements.txt
